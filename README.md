# Resume Website with Three.js Animation

### Description
This website shows a summarized version of my resume overlayed on top of a scrollable 3D animation using JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and Three.js. I intend to keep updating my website and turn it into more of a portfolio, and eventually implement React components.

### Usage
```
git clone <this-repo>
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Credits
This project was inspired by [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7AOvWpIVHU&t=168s) by fireship-io :)
